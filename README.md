## Usage
JATE functions as nothing but a simple text app, created with an automatically generated personal database express routes allowing for both interaction with and viewing of data stored. Additionally, this is also a PWA, meaning offline usage of this app is possible. When accessing it through a web browser, users are provided with an install button that caches all assets and downloads the app directly to the computer, allowing for access without the need for internet.
